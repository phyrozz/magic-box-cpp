# Magic Box in C++

## Generate Magic Squares in CMD Console

This program basically generates a magic box (or a magic square) once the user enters the size for the box.
This program can generate:
* Odd-size (eg. 3x3, 5x5, 11x11)
* Doubly-even (eg. 4x4, 8x8, 16x16)
* Singly-even (eg. 6x6, 14x14)

This repo is for our final project in Discrete Structures I.
