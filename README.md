# Magic Box in C++

## Generate Magic Squares in CMD Console

This program basically generates a magic box (or a magic square) once the user enters the size for the box.
So far, this program can generate:
> Odd-size (eg. 3x3, 5x5, 11x11)
> Doubly-even (eg. 4x4, 8x8, 16x16)

Take note that this program is still WIP!
I'm still working on singly-even squares, which I might finish within this week.

This repo is for our final project in Discrete Structures I.
